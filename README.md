The simulation produces a different result each time and works according to the requirement specification we were given. 
The design is alsoobject oriented using three classes. It uses a header file for the class definitions and global variables. 
The classes have both private and public variables and the Cell class has its own getter and setter methods. 
Each class also has a constructor and deconstructor.
Despite having 3 classes the code is rather procedural. Class forest is simply a 2D array which could have been declared 
outside of a class
